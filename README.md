THIS CODE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANY COMMERCIAL OR PRIVATE USE WITHOUT CONTACTING THE CREATOR\n
This is a learning project where I'm continuing my education in C++ and OpenGL with the goal of creating a 2D dungeon crawler. The goal of this project is to learn relevant design patterns, good coding practices, and distrubtion.  I may use this project to learn optimization after I've finished it.\nI'm very open to comments/critcism/critiques of my code (harsh or otherwise), I will do my best to respond in a timely fashion.  If you want to contact me for any reason my email is sage king ssk at gmail dot com.
